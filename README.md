# Traffic-Management-system-using-Deep-Q

Nowadays traffic congestion in Urban areas is a major issue, leading to major delays, increased fuel consumption, and high pollution levels. Our project, Traffic Management System, aims to reduce congestion by optimizing traffic lights at major intersections of the city based on real time conditions. This project uses advanced trained YOLO-based vehicle detection to classify different vehicle types and simultaneously counting them by extracting frames from live video feeds from all sides of the crossing. These counts are then used to calculate the optimal time for traffic lights, reducing waiting time thus reducing congestion.
Unlike current traffic control systems, which mostly depend on pre-set timers, our project uses AI-powered solutions to adapt to real-world conditions, making it highly efficient and scalable. The test for this project is done using pre-collected images to simulate real-life traffic conditions. While the current system focuses on traffic optimization, future iterations may include emergency vehicle prioritization, traffic rule violation detection and hardware integration for live deployment.
Our project demonstrates how AI can be used to optimize traffic conditions in the country, offering a sustainable and smart solution.
